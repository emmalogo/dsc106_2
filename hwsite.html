<p>As you can see, the amount of sales spikes for the weekends; however, you can the extent can be affected by region.
    In addition, with the fish fillet, it seems that Fridays are a popular day for their consumption,<br> which 
is suprising to see since this data is from Janauray and the religious holidays that affect fish consumption have not yet started.  </p>

  <p> To make sure that sales did not go down to the time Impossible Burger was added, we looked at the overall  
      <br> sales over the years; however, there was no indication that the sales of Impossible Burger cut into our 
      sales in the Chicken fillet, Fish fillet, and Hamburgers. That means the sales of <br>the Impossible Burger 
      would have only added to our our sales, according to this data </p
